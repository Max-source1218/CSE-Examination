Maximillian Reth B. Cruz Explanation:

    Based on a cartesian plane coordinate modeling, I designed the code to rely on X and Y coordinates. Using North Direction as a upper positive Y quadrant and lower negative Y as South direction. Using East direction as right positive X direction and West direction as left negative X direction. 

    Based on the player/user input, it computes for output.

    Scenario:

    Pressing N allows the player to move forward which then inputs (0, 1) X, Y notation
    Pressing S allows the player to move backward which subtracts to the forward step (0, 0) returning to the origin point
    Pressing E allows the player to move to the right, adding the X domain (1, 0)
    Pressing W allows the player to move to the left, subtracting the X domain (0, 0) returning to the origin point
